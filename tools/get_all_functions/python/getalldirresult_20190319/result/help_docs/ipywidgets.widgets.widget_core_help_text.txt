        CoreWidget
    
    class CoreWidget(ipywidgets.widgets.widget.Widget)

     |  
     |  has_trait(self, name)
     |      Returns True if the object has a trait with the specified name.
     |  
     |  hold_trait_notifications(self)
     |      Context manager for bundling trait change notifications and cross
     |      validation.
     |      
     |      Use this when doing multiple trait assignments (init, config), to avoid
     |      race conditions in trait notifiers requesting other trait values.
     |      All trait notifications will fire after all values have been assigned.
     |  
     |  observe(self, handler, names=traitlets.All, type='change')
     |      Setup a handler to be called when a trait changes.
     |      
     |      This is used to setup dynamic notifications of trait changes.
     |      
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      handler : callable
     |          A callable that is called when a trait changes. Its
     |          signature should be ``handler(change)``, where ``change`` is a
     |          dictionary. The change dictionary at least holds a 'type' key.
     |          * ``type``: the type of notification.
     |          Other keys may be passed depending on the value of 'type'. In the
     |          case where type is 'change', we also have the following keys:
     |          * ``owner`` : the HasTraits instance
     |          * ``old`` : the old value of the modified trait attribute
     |          * ``new`` : the new value of the modified trait attribute
     |          * ``name`` : the name of the modified trait attribute.
     |      names : list, str, All
     |          If names is All, the handler will apply to all traits.  If a list
     |          of str, handler will apply to all names in the list.  If a
     |          str, the handler will apply just to that name.
     |      type : str, All (default: 'change')
     |          The type of notification to filter by. If equal to All, then all
     |          notifications are passed to the observe handler.
     |  
     |  on_trait_change(self, handler=None, name=None, remove=False)
     |      DEPRECATED: Setup a handler to be called when a trait changes.
     |      
     |      This is used to setup dynamic notifications of trait changes.
     |      
     |      Static handlers can be created by creating methods on a HasTraits
     |      subclass with the naming convention '_[traitname]_changed'.  Thus,
     |      to create static handler for the trait 'a', create the method
     |      _a_changed(self, name, old, new) (fewer arguments can be used, see
     |      below).
     |      
     |      If `remove` is True and `handler` is not specified, all change
     |      handlers for the specified name are uninstalled.
     |      
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      handler : callable, None
     |          A callable that is called when a trait changes.  Its
     |          signature can be handler(), handler(name), handler(name, new),
     |          handler(name, old, new), or handler(name, old, new, self).
     |      name : list, str, None
     |          If None, the handler will apply to all traits.  If a list
     |          of str, handler will apply to all names in the list.  If a
     |          str, the handler will apply just to that name.
     |      remove : bool
     |          If False (the default), then install the handler.  If True
     |          then unintall it.
     |  
     |  set_trait(self, name, value)
     |      Forcibly sets trait attribute, including read-only attributes.
     |  
     |  setup_instance(self, *args, **kwargs)
     |      This is called **before** self.__init__ is called.
     |  
     |  trait_metadata(self, traitname, key, default=None)
     |      Get metadata values for trait by key.
     |  
     |  trait_names(self, **metadata)
     |      Get a list of all the names of this class' traits.
     |  
     |  traits(self, **metadata)
     |      Get a ``dict`` of all the traits of this class.  The dictionary
     |      is keyed on the name and the values are the TraitType objects.
     |      
     |      The TraitTypes returned don't know anything about the values
     |      that the various HasTrait's instances are holding.
     |      
     |      The metadata kwargs allow functions to be passed in which
     |      filter traits based on metadata values.  The functions should
     |      take a single value as an argument and return a boolean.  If
     |      any function returns False, then the trait is not included in
     |      the output.  If a metadata key doesn't exist, None will be passed
     |      to the function.
     |  
     |  unobserve(self, handler, names=traitlets.All, type='change')
     |      Remove a trait change handler.
     |      
     |      This is used to unregister handlers to trait change notifications.
     |      
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      handler : callable
     |          The callable called when a trait attribute changes.
     |      names : list, str, All (default: All)
     |          The names of the traits for which the specified handler should be
     |          uninstalled. If names is All, the specified handler is uninstalled
     |          from the list of notifiers corresponding to all changes.
     |      type : str or All (default: 'change')
     |          The type of notification to filter by. If All, the specified handler
     |          is uninstalled from the list of notifiers corresponding to all types.
     |  
     |  unobserve_all(self, name=traitlets.All)
     |      Remove trait change handlers of any type for the specified name.
     |      If name is not specified, removes all trait notifiers.
