NAME
    rsa - RSA module

DESCRIPTION
    Module for calculating large primes, and RSA encryption, decryption, signing
    and verification. Includes generating public and private keys.
    
    WARNING: this implementation does not use random padding, compression of the
    cleartext input to prevent repetitions, or other common security improvements.
    Use with care.

    class PrivateKey(AbstractKey)
     |  Represents a private RSA key.

     |  This key is also known as the 'decryption key'. It contains the 'n', 'e',

     |  faster, though.

FUNCTIONS
    decrypt(crypto, priv_key)
        Decrypts the given message using PKCS#1 v1.5
        
        The decryption is considered 'failed' when the resulting cleartext doesn't
        start with the bytes 00 02, or when the 00 byte between the padding and
        the message cannot be found.
        
        :param crypto: the crypto text as returned by :py:func:`rsa.encrypt`
        :param priv_key: the :py:class:`rsa.PrivateKey` to decrypt with.
        :raise DecryptionError: when the decryption fails. No details are given as
            to why the code thinks the decryption fails, as this would leak
            information about the private key.
        
        
        >>> import rsa
        >>> (pub_key, priv_key) = rsa.newkeys(256)
        
        It works with strings:
        
        >>> crypto = encrypt(b'hello', pub_key)
        >>> decrypt(crypto, priv_key)
        b'hello'
        
        And with binary data:
        
        >>> crypto = encrypt(b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01', pub_key)
        >>> decrypt(crypto, priv_key)
        b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01'
        
        Altering the encrypted information will *likely* cause a
        :py:class:`rsa.pkcs1.DecryptionError`. If you want to be *sure*, use
        :py:func:`rsa.sign`.
        
        
        .. warning::
        
            Never display the stack trace of a
            :py:class:`rsa.pkcs1.DecryptionError` exception. It shows where in the
            code the exception occurred, and thus leaks information about the key.
            It's only a tiny bit of information, but every bit makes cracking the
            keys easier.
        
        >>> crypto = encrypt(b'hello', pub_key)
        >>> crypto = crypto[0:5] + b'X' + crypto[6:] # change a byte
        >>> decrypt(crypto, priv_key)

        ...
        rsa.pkcs1.DecryptionError: Decryption failed
    
    encrypt(message, pub_key)
        Encrypts the given message using PKCS#1 v1.5
        
        :param message: the message to encrypt. Must be a byte string no longer than
            ``k-11`` bytes, where ``k`` is the number of bytes needed to encode
            the ``n`` component of the public key.
        :param pub_key: the :py:class:`rsa.PublicKey` to encrypt with.
        :raise OverflowError: when the message is too large to fit in the padded
            block.
        
        >>> from rsa import key, common
        >>> (pub_key, priv_key) = key.newkeys(256)
        >>> message = b'hello'
        >>> crypto = encrypt(message, pub_key)
        
        The crypto text should be just as long as the public key 'n' component:
        
        >>> len(crypto) == common.byte_size(pub_key.n)
        True
    
    newkeys(nbits, accurate=True, poolsize=1, exponent=65537)
        Generates public and private keys, and returns them as (pub, priv).
        
        The public key is also known as the 'encryption key', and is a
        :py:class:`rsa.PublicKey` object. The private key is also known as the
        'decryption key' and is a :py:class:`rsa.PrivateKey` object.
        
        :param nbits: the number of bits required to store ``n = p*q``.
        :param accurate: when True, ``n`` will have exactly the number of bits you
            asked for. However, this makes key generation much slower. When False,
            `n`` may have slightly less bits.
        :param poolsize: the number of processes to use to generate the prime
            numbers. If set to a number > 1, a parallel algorithm will be used.
            This requires Python 2.6 or newer.
        :param exponent: the exponent for the key; only change this if you know
            what you're doing, as the exponent influences how difficult your
            private key can be cracked. A very common choice for e is 65537.
        :type exponent: int
        
        :returns: a tuple (:py:class:`rsa.PublicKey`, :py:class:`rsa.PrivateKey`)
        
        The ``poolsize`` parameter was added in *Python-RSA 3.1* and requires
        Python 2.6 or newer.
    
    sign(message, priv_key, hash)
        Signs the message with the private key.
        
        Hashes the message, then signs the hash with the given key. This is known
        as a "detached signature", because the message itself isn't altered.
        
        :param message: the message to sign. Can be an 8-bit string or a file-like
            object. If ``message`` has a ``read()`` method, it is assumed to be a
            file-like object.
        :param priv_key: the :py:class:`rsa.PrivateKey` to sign with
        :param hash: the hash method used on the message. Use 'MD5', 'SHA-1',
            'SHA-256', 'SHA-384' or 'SHA-512'.
        :return: a message signature block.
        :raise OverflowError: if the private key is too small to contain the
            requested hash.
    
    verify(message, signature, pub_key)
        Verifies that the signature matches the message.
        
        The hash method is detected automatically from the signature.
        
        :param message: the signed message. Can be an 8-bit string or a file-like
            object. If ``message`` has a ``read()`` method, it is assumed to be a
            file-like object.
        :param signature: the signature block, as created with :py:func:`rsa.sign`.
        :param pub_key: the :py:class:`rsa.PublicKey` of the person signing the message.
        :raise VerificationError: when the signature doesn't match the message.
