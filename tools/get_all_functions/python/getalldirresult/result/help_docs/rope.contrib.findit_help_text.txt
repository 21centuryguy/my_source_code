FUNCTIONS
    find_definition(project, code, offset, resource=None, maxfixes=1)
        Return the definition location of the python name at `offset`
        
        A `Location` object is returned if the definition location can be
        determined, otherwise ``None`` is returned.
    
    find_implementations(project, resource, offset, resources=None, task_handle=<rope.base.taskhandle.NullTaskHandle object at 0x105bb92b0>)
        Find the places a given method is overridden.
        
        Finds the places a method is implemented.  Returns a list of
        `Location`\s.
    
    find_occurrences(project, resource, offset, unsure=False, resources=None, in_hierarchy=False, task_handle=<rope.base.taskhandle.NullTaskHandle object at 0x105bb9278>)
        Return a list of `Location`\s
        
        If `unsure` is `True`, possible matches are returned, too.  You
        can use `Location.unsure` to see which are unsure occurrences.
        `resources` can be a list of `rope.base.resource.File`\s that
        should be searched for occurrences; if `None` all python files
        in the project are searched.
