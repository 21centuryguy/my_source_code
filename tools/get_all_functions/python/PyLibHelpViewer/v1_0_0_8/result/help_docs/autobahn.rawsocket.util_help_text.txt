FUNCTIONS
    create_url(hostname, port=None, isSecure=False)
        Create a RawSocket URL from components.
        
        :param hostname: RawSocket server hostname.
        :type hostname: str
        
        :param port: RawSocket service port or None (to select default
            ports ``80`` or ``443`` depending on ``isSecure``.
        :type port: int
        
        :param isSecure: Set ``True`` for secure RawSocket (``rss`` scheme).
        :type isSecure: bool
        
        :returns: Constructed RawSocket URL.
        :rtype: str
    
    parse_url(url)
        Parses as RawSocket URL into it's components and returns a tuple (isSecure, host, port).
        
         - ``isSecure`` is a flag which is ``True`` for ``rss`` URLs.
         - ``host`` is the hostname or IP from the URL.
         - ``port`` is the port from the URL or standard port derived from
           scheme (``rs`` => ``80``, ``rss`` => ``443``).
        
        :param url: A valid RawSocket URL, i.e. ``rs://localhost:9000``
        :type url: str
        
        :returns: A tuple ``(isSecure, host, port)``.
        :rtype: tuple
