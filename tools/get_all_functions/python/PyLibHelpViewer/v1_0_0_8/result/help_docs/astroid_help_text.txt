NAME
    astroid - Python Abstract Syntax Tree New Generation

DESCRIPTION
    The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
    python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
    pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentially
    governed by pylint's needs.
    
    It extends class defined in the python's _ast module with some
    additional methods and attributes. Instance attributes are added by a
    builder object, which can either generate extended ast (let's call
    them astroid ;) by visiting an existent ast tree or by inspecting living
    object. Methods are added by monkey patching ast classes.
    
    Main modules are:
    
    * nodes and scoped_nodes for more information about methods and
      attributes added to different node classes
    
    * the manager contains a high level object to get astroid trees from
      source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously
      constructed tree for quick access
    
    * builder contains the class responsible to build astroid trees

CLASSES
    builtins.object
        AsStringRegexpPredicate
    
    class AsStringRegexpPredicate(builtins.object)
     |  ClassDef to be used as predicate that may be given to `register_transform`
     |  
     |  First argument is a regular expression that will be searched against the `as_string`
     |  representation of the node onto which it's applied.
     |  
     |  If specified, the second argument is an `attrgetter` expression that will be
     |  applied on the node first to get the actual node on which `as_string` should
     |  be called.
     |  
     |  WARNING: This can be fairly slow, as it has to convert every AST node back
     |  to Python code; you should consider examining the AST directly instead.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __call__(self, node)
     |      Call self as a function.
     |  
     |  __init__(self, regexp, expression=None)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data descriptors defined here:
     |  
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
     |  
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)

FUNCTIONS
    inference_tip(infer_function, raise_on_overwrite=False)
        Given an instance specific inference function, return a function to be
        given to MANAGER.register_transform to set this inference function.
        
        :param bool raise_on_overwrite: Raise an `InferenceOverwriteError`
            if the inference tip will overwrite another. Used for debugging
        
        Typical usage
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
           MANAGER.register_transform(Call, inference_tip(infer_named_tuple),
                                      predicate)
        
        .. Note::
        
            Using an inference tip will override
            any previously set inference tip for the given
            node. Use a predicate in the transform to prevent
            excess overwrites.
