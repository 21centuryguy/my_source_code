FUNCTIONS
    wcswidth(pwcs, n=None)
        Given a unicode string, return its printable length on a terminal.
        
        Return the width, in cells, necessary to display the first ``n``
        characters of the unicode string ``pwcs``.  When ``n`` is None (default),
        return the length of the entire string.
        
        Returns ``-1`` if a non-printable character is encountered.
    
    wcwidth(wc)
        Given one unicode character, return its printable length on a terminal.

        on a terminal (such as NUL '\0'), -1 if wc is not printable, or has an
        indeterminate effect on the terminal, such as a control character.

        graphic terminal (1 or 2) is returned.
