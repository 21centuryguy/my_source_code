NAME
    click.parser

DESCRIPTION
    click.parser
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    This module started out as largely a copy paste from the stdlib's
    optparse module with the features removed that we do not need from
    optparse because we implement them in Click on a higher level (for
    instance type handling, help formatting and a lot more).
    
    The plan is to remove more and more from here over time.
    
    The reason this is a different module and not optparse from the stdlib
    is that there are differences in 2.x and 3.x about the error messages
    generated and optparse in the stdlib uses gettext for no good reason
    and might cause us issues.

    class OptionParser(builtins.object)
     |  The option parser is an internal class that is ultimately used to
     |  parse options and arguments.  It's modelled after optparse and brings
     |  a similar but vastly simplified API.  It should generally not be used
     |  directly as the high level Click classes wrap it for you.
     |  
     |  It's not nearly as extensible as optparse or argparse as it does not
     |  implement features that are implemented on a higher level (such as
     |  types or defaults).
     |  
     |  :param ctx: optionally the :class:`~click.Context` where this parser
     |              should go with.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, ctx=None)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |  
     |  add_argument(self, dest, nargs=1, obj=None)
     |      Adds a positional argument named `dest` to the parser.
     |      
     |      The `obj` can be used to identify the option in the order list
     |      that is returned from the parser.
     |  
     |  add_option(self, opts, dest, action=None, nargs=1, const=None, obj=None)
     |      Adds a new option named `dest` to the parser.  The destination
     |      is not inferred (unlike with optparse) and needs to be explicitly
     |      provided.  Action can be any of ``store``, ``store_const``,
     |      ``append``, ``appnd_const`` or ``count``.
     |      
     |      The `obj` can be used to identify the option in the order list
     |      that is returned from the parser.
     |  
     |  parse_args(self, args)
     |      Parses positional arguments and returns ``(values, args, order)``
     |      for the parsed options and arguments as well as the leftover
     |      arguments if there are any.  The order is a list of objects as they
     |      appear on the command line.  If arguments appear multiple times they
     |      will be memorized multiple times as well.
