     |  Static methods inherited from chardet.charsetprober.CharSetProber:
     |  
     |  filter_high_byte_only(buf)
     |  
     |  filter_international_words(buf)
     |      We define three types of bytes:
     |      alphabet: english alphabets [a-zA-Z]
     |      international: international characters [-ÿ]
     |      marker: everything else [^a-zA-Z-ÿ]
     |      
     |      The input buffer can be thought to contain a series of words delimited
     |      by markers. This function works to filter all words that contain at
     |      least one international character. All contiguous sequences of markers
     |      are replaced by a single space ascii character.
     |      
     |      This filter applies to all scripts which do not use English characters.
     |  
     |  filter_with_english_letters(buf)
     |      Returns a copy of ``buf`` that retains only the sequences of English
     |      alphabet and high byte characters that are not between <> characters.
     |      Also retains English alphabet and high byte characters immediately
     |      before occurrences of >.
     |      
     |      This filter can be applied to all scripts which contain both English
     |      characters and extended ASCII characters, but is currently only used by
     |      ``Latin1Prober``.
