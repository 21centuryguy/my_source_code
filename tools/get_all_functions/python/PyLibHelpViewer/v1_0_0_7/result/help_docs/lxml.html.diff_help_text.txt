Help on module lxml.html.diff in lxml.html:

NAME
    lxml.html.diff

FUNCTIONS
    html_annotate(doclist, markup=<cyfunction default_markup at 0x10b2293e0>)
        doclist should be ordered from oldest to newest, like::
        
            >>> version1 = 'Hello World'
            >>> version2 = 'Goodbye World'
            >>> print(html_annotate([(version1, 'version 1'),
            ...                      (version2, 'version 2')]))
            <span title="version 2">Goodbye</span> <span title="version 1">World</span>
        
        The documents must be *fragments* (str/UTF8 or unicode), not
        complete documents
        
        The markup argument is a function to markup the spans of words.
        This function is called like markup('Hello', 'version 2'), and
        returns HTML.  The first argument is text and never includes any
        markup.  The default uses a span with a title:
        
            >>> print(default_markup('Some Text', 'by Joe'))
            <span title="by Joe">Some Text</span>
    
    htmldiff(old_html, new_html)
        Do a diff of the old and new document.  The documents are HTML
        *fragments* (str/UTF8 or unicode), they are not complete documents
        (i.e., no <html> tag).
        
        Returns HTML with <ins> and <del> tags added around the
        appropriate text.  
        
        Markup is generally ignored, with the markup from new_html
        preserved, and possibly some markup from old_html (though it is
        considered acceptable to lose some of the old markup).  Only the
        words in the HTML are diffed.  The exception is <img> tags, which
        are treated like words, and the href attribute of <a> tags, which
        are noted inside the tag itself when there are changes.
