FUNCTIONS
    get_current_context(silent=False)
        Returns the current click context.  This can be used as a way to
        access the current context object from anywhere.  This is a more implicit
        alternative to the :func:`pass_context` decorator.  This function is
        primarily useful for helpers such as :func:`echo` which might be
        interested in changing its behavior based on the current context.
        
        To push the current context, :meth:`Context.scope` can be used.

        :param silent: is set to `True` the return value is `None` if no context
                       is available.  The default behavior is to raise a
                       :exc:`RuntimeError`.
    
    pop_context()
        Removes the top level from the stack.

        value is passed it's returned unchanged, otherwise it's looked up from
        the current context.
