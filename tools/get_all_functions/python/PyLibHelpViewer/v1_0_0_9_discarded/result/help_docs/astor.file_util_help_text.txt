    Functions that interact with the filesystem go here.

CLASSES
    builtins.object
        CodeToAst
    
    class CodeToAst(builtins.object)
     |  Given a module, or a function that was compiled as part
     |  of a module, re-compile the module into an AST and extract
     |  the sub-AST for the function.  Allow caching to reduce
     |  number of compiles.
     |  
     |  Also contains static helper utility functions to
     |  look for python files, to parse python files, and to extract
     |  the file/line information from a code object.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __call__(self, codeobj)
     |      Call self as a function.
     |  
     |  __init__(self, cache=None)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Static methods defined here:
     |  
     |  find_py_files(srctree, ignore=None)
     |      Return all the python files in a source tree
     |      
     |      Ignores any path that contains the ignore string
     |      
     |      This is not used by other class methods, but is
     |      designed to be used in code that uses this class.
     |  
     |  get_file_info(codeobj)
     |      Returns the file and line number of a code object.
     |      
     |      If the code object has a __file__ attribute (e.g. if
     |      it is a module), then the returned line number will
     |      be 0
     |  
     |  parse_file(fname)
     |      Parse a python file into an AST.
     |      
     |      This is a very thin wrapper around ast.parse
     |      
     |          TODO: Handle encodings other than the default for Python 2

     |  Data descriptors defined here:
     |  
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
     |  
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)
