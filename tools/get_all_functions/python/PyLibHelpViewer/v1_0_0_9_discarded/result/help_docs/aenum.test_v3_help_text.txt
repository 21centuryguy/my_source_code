     |  Data descriptors inherited from aenum.Enum:
     |  
     |  name
     |      Route attribute access on a class to __getattr__.
     |      
     |      This is a descriptor, used to define attributes that act differently when
     |      accessed through an instance and through a class.  Instance access remains
     |      normal, but access to an attribute through a class will be routed to the
     |      class's __getattr__ method; this is done by raising AttributeError.

     |  Data descriptors inherited from aenum.EnumMeta:
     |  
     |  __members__
     |      Returns a mapping of member name->value.
     |      
     |      This mapping lists all enum members, including aliases. Note that this
     |      is a copy of the internal mapping.
    
    class TestEnumV3(unittest.case.TestCase)
     |  A class whose instances are single test cases.
     |  
     |  By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
     |  'runTest'.
     |  
     |  If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
     |  many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
     |  subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
     |  that the instance is to execute.
     |  
     |  Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
     |  and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
     |  implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.
     |  
     |  If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
     |  __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
     |  should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
     |  of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
     |  in order to be run.
     |  
     |  When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
     |  * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
     |      the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
     |      exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
     |  * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
     |      objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
     |      to any explicit message passed.
     |  * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
     |      by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
     |      attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.

     |  Methods inherited from unittest.case.TestCase:
     |  
     |  __call__(self, *args, **kwds)
     |      Call self as a function.
     |  
     |  __eq__(self, other)
     |      Return self==value.
     |  
     |  __hash__(self)
     |      Return hash(self).
     |  
     |  __init__(self, methodName='runTest')
     |      Create an instance of the class that will use the named test
     |      method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does
     |      not have a method with the specified name.
     |  
     |  __repr__(self)
     |      Return repr(self).
     |  
     |  __str__(self)
     |      Return str(self).
     |  
     |  addCleanup(self, function, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Add a function, with arguments, to be called when the test is
     |      completed. Functions added are called on a LIFO basis and are
     |      called after tearDown on test failure or success.
     |      
     |      Cleanup items are called even if setUp fails (unlike tearDown).
     |  
     |  addTypeEqualityFunc(self, typeobj, function)
     |      Add a type specific assertEqual style function to compare a type.
     |      
     |      This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register
     |      their own type equality functions to provide nicer error messages.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          typeobj: The data type to call this function on when both values
     |                  are of the same type in assertEqual().
     |          function: The callable taking two arguments and an optional
     |                  msg= argument that raises self.failureException with a
     |                  useful error message when the two arguments are not equal.
     |  
     |  assertAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by their
     |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
     |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
     |      difference between the two objects is more than the given
     |      delta.
     |      
     |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
     |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
     |      
     |      If the two objects compare equal then they will automatically
     |      compare almost equal.
     |  
     |  assertAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertCountEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      An unordered sequence comparison asserting that the same elements,
     |      regardless of order.  If the same element occurs more than once,
     |      it verifies that the elements occur the same number of times.
     |      
     |          self.assertEqual(Counter(list(first)),
     |                           Counter(list(second)))
     |      
     |       Example:
     |          - [0, 1, 1] and [1, 0, 1] compare equal.
     |          - [0, 0, 1] and [0, 1] compare unequal.
     |  
     |  assertDictContainsSubset(self, subset, dictionary, msg=None)
     |      Checks whether dictionary is a superset of subset.
     |  
     |  assertDictEqual(self, d1, d2, msg=None)
     |  
     |  assertEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by the '=='
     |      operator.
     |  
     |  assertEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertFalse(self, expr, msg=None)
     |      Check that the expression is false.
     |  
     |  assertGreater(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a > b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertGreaterEqual(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a >= b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a in b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIs(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
     |      Same as self.assertTrue(isinstance(obj, cls)), with a nicer
     |      default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsNone(self, obj, msg=None)
     |      Same as self.assertTrue(obj is None), with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsNot(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is not b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsNotNone(self, obj, msg=None)
     |      Included for symmetry with assertIsNone.
     |  
     |  assertLess(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a < b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertLessEqual(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a <= b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertListEqual(self, list1, list2, msg=None)
     |      A list-specific equality assertion.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          list1: The first list to compare.
     |          list2: The second list to compare.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |  
     |  assertLogs(self, logger=None, level=None)
     |      Fail unless a log message of level *level* or higher is emitted
     |      on *logger_name* or its children.  If omitted, *level* defaults to
     |      INFO and *logger* defaults to the root logger.
     |      
     |      This method must be used as a context manager, and will yield
     |      a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
     |      At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will
     |      be a list of the matching formatted log messages and the
     |      `records` attribute will be a list of the corresponding LogRecord
     |      objects.
     |      
     |      Example::
     |      
     |          with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
     |              logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
     |              logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
     |          self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
     |                                       'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])
     |  
     |  assertMultiLineEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Assert that two multi-line strings are equal.
     |  
     |  assertNotAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by their
     |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
     |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
     |      difference between the two objects is less than the given delta.
     |      
     |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
     |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
     |      
     |      Objects that are equal automatically fail.
     |  
     |  assertNotAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertNotEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by the '!='
     |      operator.
     |  
     |  assertNotEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertNotIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a not in b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertNotIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
     |      Included for symmetry with assertIsInstance.
     |  
     |  assertNotRegex(self, text, unexpected_regex, msg=None)
     |      Fail the test if the text matches the regular expression.
     |  
     |  assertNotRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertRaises(self, expected_exception, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Fail unless an exception of class expected_exception is raised
     |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
     |      keyword arguments. If a different type of exception is
     |      raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
     |      deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
     |      unexpected exception.
     |      
     |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
     |      context object used like this::
     |      
     |           with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
     |               do_something()
     |      
     |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises
     |      is used as a context object.
     |      
     |      The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as
     |      the 'exception' attribute. This allows you to inspect the
     |      exception after the assertion::
     |      
     |          with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
     |              do_something()
     |          the_exception = cm.exception
     |          self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
     |  
     |  assertRaisesRegex(self, expected_exception, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Asserts that the message in a raised exception matches a regex.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          expected_exception: Exception class expected to be raised.
     |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
     |                  to be found in error message.
     |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
     |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
     |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
     |                  when assertRaisesRegex is used as a context manager.
     |  
     |  assertRaisesRegexp = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertRegex(self, text, expected_regex, msg=None)
     |      Fail the test unless the text matches the regular expression.
     |  
     |  assertRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertSequenceEqual(self, seq1, seq2, msg=None, seq_type=None)
     |      An equality assertion for ordered sequences (like lists and tuples).
     |      
     |      For the purposes of this function, a valid ordered sequence type is one
     |      which can be indexed, has a length, and has an equality operator.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          seq1: The first sequence to compare.
     |          seq2: The second sequence to compare.
     |          seq_type: The expected datatype of the sequences, or None if no
     |                  datatype should be enforced.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |  
     |  assertSetEqual(self, set1, set2, msg=None)
     |      A set-specific equality assertion.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          set1: The first set to compare.
     |          set2: The second set to compare.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |      
     |      assertSetEqual uses ducktyping to support different types of sets, and
     |      is optimized for sets specifically (parameters must support a
     |      difference method).
     |  
     |  assertTrue(self, expr, msg=None)
     |      Check that the expression is true.
     |  
     |  assertTupleEqual(self, tuple1, tuple2, msg=None)
     |      A tuple-specific equality assertion.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          tuple1: The first tuple to compare.
     |          tuple2: The second tuple to compare.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |  
     |  assertWarns(self, expected_warning, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Fail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered
     |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
     |      keyword arguments.  If a different type of warning is
     |      triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
     |      warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed
     |      out, or raised as an exception.
     |      
     |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
     |      context object used like this::
     |      
     |           with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
     |               do_something()
     |      
     |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns
     |      is used as a context object.
     |      
     |      The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching
     |      warning as the 'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename'
     |      and 'lineno' attributes give you information about the line
     |      of Python code from which the warning was triggered.
     |      This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::
     |      
     |          with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
     |              do_something()
     |          the_warning = cm.warning
     |          self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
     |  
     |  assertWarnsRegex(self, expected_warning, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Asserts that the message in a triggered warning matches a regexp.
     |      Basic functioning is similar to assertWarns() with the addition
     |      that only warnings whose messages also match the regular expression
     |      are considered successful matches.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          expected_warning: Warning class expected to be triggered.
     |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
     |                  to be found in error message.
     |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
     |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
     |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
     |                  when assertWarnsRegex is used as a context manager.

     |  subTest(self, msg=<object object at 0x10e2c8260>, **params)
     |      Return a context manager that will return the enclosed block
     |      of code in a subtest identified by the optional message and
     |      keyword parameters.  A failure in the subtest marks the test
     |      case as failed but resumes execution at the end of the enclosed
     |      block, allowing further test code to be executed.
     |

    class TestNamedTupleV3(unittest.case.TestCase)
     |  A class whose instances are single test cases.
     |  
     |  By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
     |  'runTest'.
     |  
     |  If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
     |  many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
     |  subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
     |  that the instance is to execute.
     |  
     |  Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
     |  and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
     |  implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.
     |  
     |  If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
     |  __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
     |  should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
     |  of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
     |  in order to be run.
     |  
     |  When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
     |  * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
     |      the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
     |      exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
     |  * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
     |      objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
     |      to any explicit message passed.
     |  * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
     |      by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
     |      attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.
     |

     |      Return self==value.
     |  
     |  __hash__(self)
     |      Return hash(self).
     |  
     |  __init__(self, methodName='runTest')
     |      Create an instance of the class that will use the named test
     |      method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does
     |      not have a method with the specified name.
     |

     |      Return repr(self).

     |  __str__(self)
     |      Return str(self).
     |  
     |  addCleanup(self, function, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Add a function, with arguments, to be called when the test is
     |      completed. Functions added are called on a LIFO basis and are
     |      called after tearDown on test failure or success.
     |      
     |      Cleanup items are called even if setUp fails (unlike tearDown).
     |  
     |  addTypeEqualityFunc(self, typeobj, function)
     |      Add a type specific assertEqual style function to compare a type.
     |      
     |      This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register
     |      their own type equality functions to provide nicer error messages.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          typeobj: The data type to call this function on when both values
     |                  are of the same type in assertEqual().
     |          function: The callable taking two arguments and an optional
     |                  msg= argument that raises self.failureException with a
     |                  useful error message when the two arguments are not equal.
     |  
     |  assertAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by their
     |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
     |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
     |      difference between the two objects is more than the given
     |      delta.
     |      
     |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
     |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
     |      
     |      If the two objects compare equal then they will automatically
     |      compare almost equal.
     |  
     |  assertAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertCountEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      An unordered sequence comparison asserting that the same elements,
     |      regardless of order.  If the same element occurs more than once,
     |      it verifies that the elements occur the same number of times.
     |      
     |          self.assertEqual(Counter(list(first)),
     |                           Counter(list(second)))
     |      
     |       Example:
     |          - [0, 1, 1] and [1, 0, 1] compare equal.
     |          - [0, 0, 1] and [0, 1] compare unequal.
     |  
     |  assertDictContainsSubset(self, subset, dictionary, msg=None)
     |      Checks whether dictionary is a superset of subset.
     |  
     |  assertDictEqual(self, d1, d2, msg=None)
     |  
     |  assertEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by the '=='
     |      operator.
     |  
     |  assertEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertFalse(self, expr, msg=None)
     |      Check that the expression is false.
     |  
     |  assertGreater(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a > b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertGreaterEqual(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a >= b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a in b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIs(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
     |      Same as self.assertTrue(isinstance(obj, cls)), with a nicer
     |      default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsNone(self, obj, msg=None)
     |      Same as self.assertTrue(obj is None), with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsNot(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is not b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsNotNone(self, obj, msg=None)
     |      Included for symmetry with assertIsNone.
     |  
     |  assertLess(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a < b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertLessEqual(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a <= b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertListEqual(self, list1, list2, msg=None)
     |      A list-specific equality assertion.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          list1: The first list to compare.
     |          list2: The second list to compare.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |  
     |  assertLogs(self, logger=None, level=None)
     |      Fail unless a log message of level *level* or higher is emitted
     |      on *logger_name* or its children.  If omitted, *level* defaults to
     |      INFO and *logger* defaults to the root logger.
     |      
     |      This method must be used as a context manager, and will yield
     |      a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
     |      At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will
     |      be a list of the matching formatted log messages and the
     |      `records` attribute will be a list of the corresponding LogRecord
     |      objects.
     |      
     |      Example::
     |      
     |          with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
     |              logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
     |              logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
     |          self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
     |                                       'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])
     |  
     |  assertMultiLineEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Assert that two multi-line strings are equal.
     |  
     |  assertNotAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by their
     |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
     |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
     |      difference between the two objects is less than the given delta.
     |      
     |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
     |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
     |      
     |      Objects that are equal automatically fail.
     |  
     |  assertNotAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertNotEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by the '!='
     |      operator.
     |  
     |  assertNotEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertNotIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a not in b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertNotIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
     |      Included for symmetry with assertIsInstance.
     |  
     |  assertNotRegex(self, text, unexpected_regex, msg=None)
     |      Fail the test if the text matches the regular expression.
     |  
     |  assertNotRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertRaises(self, expected_exception, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Fail unless an exception of class expected_exception is raised
     |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
     |      keyword arguments. If a different type of exception is
     |      raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
     |      deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
     |      unexpected exception.
     |      
     |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
     |      context object used like this::
     |      
     |           with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
     |               do_something()
     |      
     |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises
     |      is used as a context object.
     |      
     |      The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as
     |      the 'exception' attribute. This allows you to inspect the
     |      exception after the assertion::
     |      
     |          with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
     |              do_something()
     |          the_exception = cm.exception
     |          self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
     |  
     |  assertRaisesRegex(self, expected_exception, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Asserts that the message in a raised exception matches a regex.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          expected_exception: Exception class expected to be raised.
     |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
     |                  to be found in error message.
     |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
     |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
     |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
     |                  when assertRaisesRegex is used as a context manager.
     |  
     |  assertRaisesRegexp = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertRegex(self, text, expected_regex, msg=None)
     |      Fail the test unless the text matches the regular expression.
     |  
     |  assertRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertSequenceEqual(self, seq1, seq2, msg=None, seq_type=None)
     |      An equality assertion for ordered sequences (like lists and tuples).
     |      
     |      For the purposes of this function, a valid ordered sequence type is one
     |      which can be indexed, has a length, and has an equality operator.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          seq1: The first sequence to compare.
     |          seq2: The second sequence to compare.
     |          seq_type: The expected datatype of the sequences, or None if no
     |                  datatype should be enforced.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |  
     |  assertSetEqual(self, set1, set2, msg=None)
     |      A set-specific equality assertion.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          set1: The first set to compare.
     |          set2: The second set to compare.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |      
     |      assertSetEqual uses ducktyping to support different types of sets, and
     |      is optimized for sets specifically (parameters must support a
     |      difference method).
     |  
     |  assertTrue(self, expr, msg=None)
     |      Check that the expression is true.
     |  
     |  assertTupleEqual(self, tuple1, tuple2, msg=None)
     |      A tuple-specific equality assertion.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          tuple1: The first tuple to compare.
     |          tuple2: The second tuple to compare.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |  
     |  assertWarns(self, expected_warning, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Fail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered
     |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
     |      keyword arguments.  If a different type of warning is
     |      triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
     |      warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed
     |      out, or raised as an exception.
     |      
     |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
     |      context object used like this::
     |      
     |           with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
     |               do_something()
     |      
     |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns
     |      is used as a context object.
     |      
     |      The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching
     |      warning as the 'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename'
     |      and 'lineno' attributes give you information about the line
     |      of Python code from which the warning was triggered.
     |      This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::
     |      
     |          with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
     |              do_something()
     |          the_warning = cm.warning
     |          self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
     |  
     |  assertWarnsRegex(self, expected_warning, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Asserts that the message in a triggered warning matches a regexp.
     |      Basic functioning is similar to assertWarns() with the addition
     |      that only warnings whose messages also match the regular expression
     |      are considered successful matches.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          expected_warning: Warning class expected to be triggered.
     |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
     |                  to be found in error message.
     |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
     |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
     |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
     |                  when assertWarnsRegex is used as a context manager.

     |  subTest(self, msg=<object object at 0x10e2c8260>, **params)
     |      Return a context manager that will return the enclosed block
     |      of code in a subtest identified by the optional message and
     |      keyword parameters.  A failure in the subtest marks the test
     |      case as failed but resumes execution at the end of the enclosed
     |      block, allowing further test code to be executed.

    class TestOrderV3(unittest.case.TestCase)
     |  A class whose instances are single test cases.
     |  
     |  By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
     |  'runTest'.
     |  
     |  If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
     |  many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
     |  subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
     |  that the instance is to execute.
     |  
     |  Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
     |  and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
     |  implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.
     |  
     |  If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
     |  __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
     |  should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
     |  of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
     |  in order to be run.
     |  
     |  When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
     |  * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
     |      the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
     |      exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
     |  * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
     |      objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
     |      to any explicit message passed.
     |  * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
     |      by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
     |      attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.

     |      Return self==value.
     |  
     |  __hash__(self)
     |      Return hash(self).
     |  
     |  __init__(self, methodName='runTest')
     |      Create an instance of the class that will use the named test
     |      method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does
     |      not have a method with the specified name.

     |  __str__(self)
     |      Return str(self).
     |  
     |  addCleanup(self, function, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Add a function, with arguments, to be called when the test is
     |      completed. Functions added are called on a LIFO basis and are
     |      called after tearDown on test failure or success.
     |      
     |      Cleanup items are called even if setUp fails (unlike tearDown).
     |  
     |  addTypeEqualityFunc(self, typeobj, function)
     |      Add a type specific assertEqual style function to compare a type.
     |      
     |      This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register
     |      their own type equality functions to provide nicer error messages.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          typeobj: The data type to call this function on when both values
     |                  are of the same type in assertEqual().
     |          function: The callable taking two arguments and an optional
     |                  msg= argument that raises self.failureException with a
     |                  useful error message when the two arguments are not equal.
     |  
     |  assertAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by their
     |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
     |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
     |      difference between the two objects is more than the given
     |      delta.
     |      
     |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
     |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
     |      
     |      If the two objects compare equal then they will automatically
     |      compare almost equal.
     |  
     |  assertAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertCountEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      An unordered sequence comparison asserting that the same elements,
     |      regardless of order.  If the same element occurs more than once,
     |      it verifies that the elements occur the same number of times.
     |      
     |          self.assertEqual(Counter(list(first)),
     |                           Counter(list(second)))
     |      
     |       Example:
     |          - [0, 1, 1] and [1, 0, 1] compare equal.
     |          - [0, 0, 1] and [0, 1] compare unequal.
     |  
     |  assertDictContainsSubset(self, subset, dictionary, msg=None)
     |      Checks whether dictionary is a superset of subset.
     |  
     |  assertDictEqual(self, d1, d2, msg=None)
     |  
     |  assertEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by the '=='
     |      operator.
     |  
     |  assertEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertFalse(self, expr, msg=None)
     |      Check that the expression is false.
     |  
     |  assertGreater(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a > b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertGreaterEqual(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a >= b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a in b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIs(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
     |      Same as self.assertTrue(isinstance(obj, cls)), with a nicer
     |      default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsNone(self, obj, msg=None)
     |      Same as self.assertTrue(obj is None), with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsNot(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is not b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertIsNotNone(self, obj, msg=None)
     |      Included for symmetry with assertIsNone.
     |  
     |  assertLess(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a < b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertLessEqual(self, a, b, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a <= b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertListEqual(self, list1, list2, msg=None)
     |      A list-specific equality assertion.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          list1: The first list to compare.
     |          list2: The second list to compare.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |  
     |  assertLogs(self, logger=None, level=None)
     |      Fail unless a log message of level *level* or higher is emitted
     |      on *logger_name* or its children.  If omitted, *level* defaults to
     |      INFO and *logger* defaults to the root logger.
     |      
     |      This method must be used as a context manager, and will yield
     |      a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
     |      At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will
     |      be a list of the matching formatted log messages and the
     |      `records` attribute will be a list of the corresponding LogRecord
     |      objects.
     |      
     |      Example::
     |      
     |          with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
     |              logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
     |              logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
     |          self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
     |                                       'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])
     |  
     |  assertMultiLineEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Assert that two multi-line strings are equal.
     |  
     |  assertNotAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by their
     |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
     |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
     |      difference between the two objects is less than the given delta.
     |      
     |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
     |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
     |      
     |      Objects that are equal automatically fail.
     |  
     |  assertNotAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertNotEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
     |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by the '!='
     |      operator.
     |  
     |  assertNotEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertNotIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
     |      Just like self.assertTrue(a not in b), but with a nicer default message.
     |  
     |  assertNotIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
     |      Included for symmetry with assertIsInstance.
     |  
     |  assertNotRegex(self, text, unexpected_regex, msg=None)
     |      Fail the test if the text matches the regular expression.
     |  
     |  assertNotRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertRaises(self, expected_exception, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Fail unless an exception of class expected_exception is raised
     |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
     |      keyword arguments. If a different type of exception is
     |      raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
     |      deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
     |      unexpected exception.
     |      
     |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
     |      context object used like this::
     |      
     |           with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
     |               do_something()
     |      
     |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises
     |      is used as a context object.
     |      
     |      The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as
     |      the 'exception' attribute. This allows you to inspect the
     |      exception after the assertion::
     |      
     |          with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
     |              do_something()
     |          the_exception = cm.exception
     |          self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
     |  
     |  assertRaisesRegex(self, expected_exception, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Asserts that the message in a raised exception matches a regex.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          expected_exception: Exception class expected to be raised.
     |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
     |                  to be found in error message.
     |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
     |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
     |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
     |                  when assertRaisesRegex is used as a context manager.
     |  
     |  assertRaisesRegexp = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertRegex(self, text, expected_regex, msg=None)
     |      Fail the test unless the text matches the regular expression.
     |  
     |  assertRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  assertSequenceEqual(self, seq1, seq2, msg=None, seq_type=None)
     |      An equality assertion for ordered sequences (like lists and tuples).
     |      
     |      For the purposes of this function, a valid ordered sequence type is one
     |      which can be indexed, has a length, and has an equality operator.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          seq1: The first sequence to compare.
     |          seq2: The second sequence to compare.
     |          seq_type: The expected datatype of the sequences, or None if no
     |                  datatype should be enforced.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |  
     |  assertSetEqual(self, set1, set2, msg=None)
     |      A set-specific equality assertion.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          set1: The first set to compare.
     |          set2: The second set to compare.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |      
     |      assertSetEqual uses ducktyping to support different types of sets, and
     |      is optimized for sets specifically (parameters must support a
     |      difference method).
     |  
     |  assertTrue(self, expr, msg=None)
     |      Check that the expression is true.
     |  
     |  assertTupleEqual(self, tuple1, tuple2, msg=None)
     |      A tuple-specific equality assertion.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          tuple1: The first tuple to compare.
     |          tuple2: The second tuple to compare.
     |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
     |                  differences.
     |  
     |  assertWarns(self, expected_warning, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Fail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered
     |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
     |      keyword arguments.  If a different type of warning is
     |      triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
     |      warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed
     |      out, or raised as an exception.
     |      
     |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
     |      context object used like this::
     |      
     |           with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
     |               do_something()
     |      
     |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns
     |      is used as a context object.
     |      
     |      The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching
     |      warning as the 'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename'
     |      and 'lineno' attributes give you information about the line
     |      of Python code from which the warning was triggered.
     |      This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::
     |      
     |          with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
     |              do_something()
     |          the_warning = cm.warning
     |          self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
     |  
     |  assertWarnsRegex(self, expected_warning, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Asserts that the message in a triggered warning matches a regexp.
     |      Basic functioning is similar to assertWarns() with the addition
     |      that only warnings whose messages also match the regular expression
     |      are considered successful matches.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |          expected_warning: Warning class expected to be triggered.
     |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
     |                  to be found in error message.
     |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
     |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
     |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
     |                  when assertWarnsRegex is used as a context manager.

     |  
     |  shortDescription(self)
     |      Returns a one-line description of the test, or None if no
     |      description has been provided.
     |      
     |      The default implementation of this method returns the first line of
     |      the specified test method's docstring.
     |  
     |  skipTest(self, reason)
     |      Skip this test.
     |  
     |  subTest(self, msg=<object object at 0x10e2c8260>, **params)
     |      Return a context manager that will return the enclosed block
     |      of code in a subtest identified by the optional message and
     |      keyword parameters.  A failure in the subtest marks the test
     |      case as failed but resumes execution at the end of the enclosed
     |      block, allowing further test code to be executed.
     |  
     |  tearDown(self)
     |      Hook method for deconstructing the test fixture after testing it.

FUNCTIONS
    dumps(obj, protocol=None, *, fix_imports=True)
        Return the pickled representation of the object as a bytes object.
        
        The optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the given
        protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.  The default
        protocol is 3; a backward-incompatible protocol designed for Python 3.
        
        Specifying a negative protocol version selects the highest protocol
        version supported.  The higher the protocol used, the more recent the
        version of Python needed to read the pickle produced.
        
        If *fix_imports* is True and *protocol* is less than 3, pickle will
        try to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in
        Python 2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.
    
    loads(data, *, fix_imports=True, encoding='ASCII', errors='strict')
        Read and return an object from the given pickle data.
        
        The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so no
        protocol argument is needed.  Bytes past the pickled object's
        representation are ignored.
        
        Optional keyword arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and *errors*,
        which are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream
        generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True, pickle will try to
        map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.  The
        *encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string
        instances pickled by Python 2; these default to 'ASCII' and 'strict',
        respectively.  The *encoding* can be 'bytes' to read these 8-bit
        string instances as bytes objects.
